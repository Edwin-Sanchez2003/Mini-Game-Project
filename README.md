# GDG MiniGame Project
The MiniGame Project made by the Game Developers' Group at IUPUI.

## Teams
These are the sub-teams for the project. You will need to push your branch to this group's branch in the repo before it can be pushed to the main branch (see [Source Control Rules](#source-control-rules)).

* **Programmers:** Makes the doohickeys move in our game.
* **Artists:** Makes things actually look good in the game.

## Source Control Rules
In order to keep the project organized and maintained, we need to follow some rules.

1. **Each developer will need to have their own branch.** You will push your changes to this branch as you work. You do not need this work to be perfect, just use this branch to save your changes as you work - lets avoid losing hours of work!
2. **Once changes are ready & approved, you will then push to one of the sub-branches for your team: (Programmers, Artists, etc.).** This will contain code for your team/group, and help to catch issues before they get to main. You will need to work with the team lead to get your changes pushed. The team lead will need to make sure your push is successful and that it works with the project, and resolve issues if it doesn't.
3. **Once a set of core components are ready to be added to the main project, we will push it to the main branch.** This will be a job for each team's leader, who will now have to work with the project leader to make sure all of the changes work and the main project still works. It is the responsibility of the project lead to resolve issues with the team leader during this process.
4. **Prepare for inter-script interactions.** There will be times where we need to edit scripts so that they can interact with scripts made by our other developers. We need to try and anticipate these conflicts ahead of time and make a plan for them with our team leads and our project lead. If you realize you need to edit something outside of what you originally thought, make sure to communicate this with your team lead! See [Tips](#tips) for more details.

### Tips
* **Commit your changes often!** Get used to using Git & GitHub, and commit any changes you make to your branch every time you get something new working or have spend a decent amount of time making changes. This will help you to avoid losing lots of work if the worst happens - and trust me, it does!
* **Don't edit files that you aren't responsible for!!!** Merge conflicts are messy in git, even for experienced source control users... So we can avoid this by only making changes in files that you are responsible for as an individual. It will be team lead's responsibility to organize interactions between different developers' scripts, and the project leader's responsibility to manage between teams, if necessary. If you can't get your code to work without editing a certain file, talk with your team lead. You can work out how to best make those changes.
